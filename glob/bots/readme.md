# The Insomina Bot

This was a for-fun project trying to figure out a way to keep my computer awake without having to configure any OS settings. It's basically an always-on app that presses the control key every 5 minutes to keep the computer from sleeping/locking. This was a simple test of the Robot class to see if it would even work. I turned this into a mini-app in some other repo.
